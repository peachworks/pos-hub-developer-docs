# Overview

The POS Hub API allows for the simple integration of a POS system with the Beyond One Platform. 

POS Hub creates a 2-way connection between one or more POS systems and Beyond One. The app gives users an easy way to standardize menu item names and connect shift or sales data to use with other solutions.

# Setting Up a Test Account

In order to send your POS data to Peach, you'll need an account with a subscription to the POS Hub App. 

Once you have account credentials,

* Go to https://my.getbeyond.com and enter your username and password
* click on the POS Hub application icon
** Enter the System Setup wizard
** There is an option in the first step of the wizard to choose a POS system.  Select "Direct".
** In the next step, select the locations (which individual restaurants) you want to set up on that system
* On the final step, we generate a pos_token for each location selected, and display it for you.
** The pos_token is hashed and contains the source, location, account IDs and the account_token
* **The POS customer must use that pos_token when sending us data**

# Connecting

We use a RESTful API.

These are resources used to add/remove data from POS Hub

## Authentication/authorization

The type of authentication is using a _pos_token_, as it is the simplest method with the least amount of data to copy and know about.

The method for POS Token authorization is to include an "Authorization:" header in the HTTP headers.  The content of this header is the pos_token:

```
     curl -X DELETE "https://hub.peachworks.com/v1/things" -H "Authorization: ELO5afhGRMfRq05Zenk4ZlwFdDJttHuZ5dT12Zd6ASn…"
```

# Configuration Data

Config data is consists of definitions for the following things

* Categories - list of sales categories (ex. Apps, Entrees, Desserts)
* Items - list of sales items (ex. Pizza, Burger, Wings)
* Order Types - list of order types (ex. Table, Tab, Delivery) 
* Revenue Centers - list of revenue centers (ex. Dining Room, Bar, Drive Thru)
* Voids - list of void reasons (ex. 86'd, Server Error)
* Discounts - list of discounts (ex. Guest Satisfaction, 10% Off, $5 Off)
* House Accounts - list of house accounts (ex. )
* Paid In/Outs - list of paid in/out reasons (ex. )
* Payment Types - list of payment/tender types (ex. Master Card, Cash, Amex)
* Employees - list of employees 
* Jobs - list of jobs (ex. Server, Cashier, Bartender)


> The "id" field for these can be a number or a string.
> A string ID is helpful in cases where a numeric ID is not available. For example, if a category named "Apps" did not have an ID, you can also use "Apps" as the ID.



## Master Lists & Mapping

### How Mapping Works

#### Config Data

We treat each _config data set_ as _unique to the selected location_ and source, and then we map these data sets to the _master list_ for each config type.

EXAMPLE:  If a POS sends the item "Wings" as part of the config data set, and it has not been added _from the source and location sending it_, Peach will:

* check for an existing master item called "Wings" 
   * if found, this "Wings" would map to the master "Wings";  
   * if not found, Peach would create a new _master item_ called "Wings".

**So the same item in multiple locations and/or sources can map to a single master item.**


> In POS Hub, a user can always remap items to a different master.

#### Other Data

For all other data, the mapping procedure is similar, in that the relevant fields will first be looked for in the individual location and then the master list.  Here is the process step-by-step for (as an example) a piece of data of type "discount":

1.  Upon upload, the POS Hub system will look at the combination of source + location + pos_discount_ id to determine where to look
1. If all match an existing POS discount in the mapping table, it will then look at the name (the mapping field, as defined in this document, for /discount)
  1.  If the name is the same, no changes to the list will occur - a discount with that name already exists, and will simply be recorded
  1. If the name of the discount has changed from what is in pos_discount_id, the name in the mapping table will get updated _and_ a new wtm master item will be created.  If there are no other pos discounts in the original master, the master would be empty and would get auto-deleted.
1. If the source, location, or pos_discount_ id do not match (or do not exist), Hub will then look to see if a _master_ item exists with the same name  
   1. If there is a master with the same name, the new pos_discount_ id is added to the mapping table and assigned to the matching master item
   1. if there is not a master with the same name, we create a new master item and map the POS item to it

### Further notes on mapping:

* if the app admin changes a wtm master item name in Hub, those changes will stay and the pos item will remain mapped to this master on subsequent syncs
* if the app admin changes a wtm master item name in Hub and then the name changes on the POS, a new name is recognized and a new master item is created.  The original wtm master item will be empty and thus auto-deleted


## Mapping Objects

### Categories

Categories are sales categories for items and can be hierarchical.

* ID and NAME are required. 
* Maps on **"name" + "parent_id"**

```xml
// XML

<category>
	<id>10</id>
	<name>Apps</name>
	<parent_id>2</parent_id>
</category>
```

* Maps on **"name" + "category_id"**

```xml
// XML
<item>
    <id>1</id>
    <name>12 Wings</name>
    <category_id>1000</category_id>
    <price>8.99</price>
    <sku>7A12345-WHT-X</sku>
</item>
```

### Revenue Centers

Revenue centers.

* ID and NAME are REQUIRED.

House accounts (i.e. customer accounts for in-house tabs and similar):  These use "customer_accounts" as their API object, but are referred to on the front-end as "House Accounts", for consistency reasons.

* ID and NAME are REQUIRED. 
* No auto-mapping:  all new house accounts are added to the master list.

```xml
// XML
<customer_account>
    <id>22</id>
    <name>Antonio Smith</name>
</customer_account>
```

# Check Data

## Required Check Fields

A "check" refers to a single customer bill of sale (not to a personal check used for payment).

The required primary data fields for every check are...
| Field              | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| check\_id          | string     | unique ID for a check for a given POS in a location. If the POS System does not provide a unique ID, you can try combining the check number with the check open datetime.                                                                                                                                                 |
| check\_number      | string     | the check number, if no check number exists, you can use the check\_id. This does not need to be unique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| business\_time     | time       | time used for reporting the sales. This is a local time (not UTC) and is used so that we can easily report on sales from 3-4pm at multiple locations across different time zones. In our own integrations, we would need to calculate this field if we are provided UTC time data by looking up the locations time zone. |

## Updating Check Data
Send the updated check data exactly as you would if adding it for the first time. If the check ID already exists, the data will be updated.

> If you're unsure of changes within individual checks, it is often simpler (and less error prone) to delete the checks for a period of time and then add them again.

## Deleting Check Data
If deleting  check data in order to reload it, see "Reloading Check Data" below to eliminate the need for a separate API request for deletion.

### Deleting Checks By Day

* start_date and end_date are required and it can be either an ISO date or an array of ISO dates
* If any checks on any date provided can't be deleted for any reason this will return an error and nothing deleted
   * 400 {"status":"error", "message":"Could not delete checks: <comma separated list of check ids>. Nothing was deleted."}
* Returns 200 {"status":"success", "delete_count":integer} on success
* When deciding the date to delete, use check.business_date
	
#### Example Request
```
DELETE /v1/checks
Authorization: eukj3pos_token…
{
  "start_date":"2013-08-28",
  "end_date":"2013-08-28"
}
  
Returns
200
{
  "status":"success",
  "delete_count":153
}
```

#### Example Curl Request
`curl -X DELETE --form start_date=2013-08-28 --form end_date=2013-08-28 -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" https://hub.peachworks.com/v1/checks`

### Deleting Checks By ID
* "ids" is used and can be either one check id or an array of check ids
* If any checks can't be deleted for any reason this will return an error and nothing deleted
   * 400 {"status":"error", "message":"Could not delete checks: <comma separated list of check ids>. Nothing was deleted."}
	
#### Example Request
```
DELETE /v1/checks
Authorization: eukj3pos_token…
{
  "ids":["304773739739","30477373974","3047737392"],
//or
 "ids":"304773739739",  <-- note this also should work for one check_id
}
  
Returns
200
{
  "status":"success",
  "delete_count":3
}
```

#### Example Curl Request
`curl -X DELETE --form ids=10198702 -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" https://hub.peachworks.com/v1/checks`


## Reloading Check Data
In the case of just missing or bad data, the merchant can request specific days to be reloaded in Beyond One, these requested business days are available to integrators from our server using `/v1/instructions` .  If the array is empty, no missing days have been reported.

* /v1/instructions (GET)
   * authorize with the given pos_token(s), which the integration should have saved per source+location, just like normal uploads
   * response body is similar to:
      * `{ "reload": ["2016-03-01", "2016-03-02"], "is_active": true, "other": "things" }`
      * The only keys that apply universally are "reload" and “is_active”, but ignore everything except reload for now.
 
To reload the check data, a full day’s data should be generated and then uploaded to the `/v1/checks` end point with an additional query parameter indicating that this is a reload for a specific business date `?reload_date=2016-04-01`

This way the server knows that the integrator is uploading a replacement day and will DELETE the existing transactions on that business date before adding the new transactions. This will also update the reload requests (if there is one) as completed after a successful load.

for example:
```
POST /v1/transactions?reload_date=2016-04-01
[multipart-form with XML file] 
```

### When Data Isn't Available for a Day
If the client no longer has any data for a requested business date, due to the data having been deleted or maybe the store was actually closed that day, then the integrator can send an unavailable status so the server won’t ask for this day again.

* `/v1/client_status (POST)`
   * authorize with the given pos_token(s), which the integration should have saved per source+location, just like normal uploads
   * Parameters
      * unavailable_days - is an array of dates for which the client cannot upload the data because it is missing. Time part will be ignored.

for example:

```
POST /v1/client_status
{“unavailable_days”: [“2018-12-25”, “2017-12-25”, “2018-01-01”] }
```

### Testing during development
One thing you will need to do for testing is to set the reload_days on your own to trigger your systems’s reaction to the instructions.  This is the endpoint where that happens

* `/v1/reload_days (POST)`
   * The endpoint will not let there be more than 31 entries per source/location at a time, to prevent a large burden on the system from reloading.
   * an example of the request body:

## Updating Shift Data
Send the updated shift data exactly as you would if adding it for the first time. If the shift ID already exists, the data will be updated.

> If you're unsure of changes within an individual shift, it is often simpler (and less error prone) to delete the shifts for a period of time and then add them again.

## Deleting Shift Data
If deleting shift data in order to reload it, see "Reloading Check Data" below to eliminate the need for a separate API request for deletion.

### Deleting Shifts By Day

* start_date and end_date are required and it can be either an ISO date or an array of ISO dates
* If any shifts on any date provided can't be deleted for any reason this will return an error and nothing deleted
   * Returns 400 `{"status":"error", "message":"Could not delete shifts: <comma separated list of shift ids>. Nothing was deleted."}`
* Returns 200 `{"status":"success", "delete_count":_integer_}` on success
* When deciding the date to delete, use shift.business_date

#### Example Request
```
DELETE /v1/shifts
Authorization: eukj3pos_token…
{
  "start_date":"2013-08-28",
  "end_date":"2013-08-28",
}
  
Returns
200
{
  "status":"success",
  "delete_count":153
}
```

#### Example Curl Request
`curl -X DELETE --form start_date=2013-08-28 --form end_date=2013-08-28 -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" https://hub.peachworks.com/v1/shifts`

### Deleting Shifts By ID
* "ids" is used and can be either one shift id or an array of shift ids
* If any shifts can't be deleted for any reason this will return an error and nothing deleted
   * 400 {"status":"error", "message":"Could not delete shifts: <comma separated list of shift ids>. Nothing was deleted."}
	
#### Example Request
```
DELETE /v1/shifts
Authorization: eukj3pos_token…
{
  "ids":["304773739739","30477373974","3047737392"],
//or
 "ids":"304773739739",  <-- note this also should work for one check_id
}
  
Returns
200
{
  "status":"success",
  "delete_count":3
}
```

#### Example Curl Request
`curl -X DELETE --form ids=10198702 -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" https://hub.peachworks.com/v1/shifts`

# Scheduled Shift Exports

## Request

* Accessible only with pos_token authorization.  The token should be put in the "Authorization" header.
* If the account is not subscribed to Schedule, the only result returned will be a 404 status.
* When no requested date range is given, all upcoming scheduled/published shifts are returned from the next four weeks and including those from today (the whole day, even if some are already completed).
* The range of shifts sent, in any case, is limited to four weeks of future shifts from “today” and then the past seven days, so one may fetch all of “this week”.
* Shifts are only returned for employees+jobs which have synced over from the POS.  If an employee were created in Peach and had no associated POS ID, their shifts would not be included.

Additional parameters maybe be supplied if a specific date range is needed.

* All timestamps may include a timezone, e.g. "2017-03-01T07:30:00-04:00" for specificity.  If no timezone is present on the timestamp then "local store time" is assumed.
* "start" and "end" may be bare dates "2017-03-20", which will return the whole business day's shifts.

| Optional Parameters (names case sensitive) | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

When "end" is omitted "start" will return all shifts after start time. If included, "end" should be no later than four weeks from today.  Otherwise an error status is returned. |
| modified                                   | timestamp - fetch all shifts modified since the given time. shifts earlier than "today" are not included. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss format. Supplying a "modified" parameter will cause the "start" and "end" to be ignored.                                                                 |
| include\_names                             | Boolean.  Include the POS names for employees, **<first + " " + last\>** in one field, and jobs. (Most of the time you don't want this, unless it's for a system like Aloha that uses names in the export.)
                                                                      |
